Resulting files are located on root of the project:
EMT.php

Use tools-php/online.php to test php version of the Typograph.

tools-php/example.php contains few examples, how to use typograph inside php.
tools-py/run.py contains examples, how to use typograph inside python.

TESTING

To run tests for php version you should go to the page tools-php/test.php through web-server.
On this page you hit start to run all the tests.
